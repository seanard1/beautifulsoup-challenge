# beautifulsoup-challenge
Module 11 challenge using HTML scrapping, Beautiful Soup and parsing.

## Introduction/Premise

This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

## Summary

The part_1_mars_news Jupyter Notebook uses webscraping to scrape, parse and organize headlines from a website about Mars news and store the result in a dictionary. Chrome DevTools was used to identify the needed tags for organization, with splinter and beautifulsoup used to collect the data.

The part_2_mars_weather Jupyter Notebook repeats the web scraping process, then further analyzes the data using the pandas and matplotlib skills developed in previous modules to answer a series of questions. 

Ouputs include a CSV file of the article data from Part 1 in the Data folder and four visuals from Part 2 in the Visuals folder.
